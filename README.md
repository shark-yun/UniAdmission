# University Admission 
Examine how the university admission rate may be influenced by various factors, we visualize the admission rate with respect to different features. This can include comparing the admission rates for male and female applicants, as well as for students from religious and non-religious schools or from private and public schools.

We can create visual representations such as bar charts or stacked bar charts for each independent variable to show the admission rates for each level. For instance, one chart can compare the admission rates for male and female applicants, while another chart can compare admission rates for students from religious and non-religious schools. Likewise, another chart can compare admission rates for students from private and public schools. By analyzing these charts, we can gain insights into how different factors may affect the university admission rate.
